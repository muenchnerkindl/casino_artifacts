## Contents

This repository contains the material of the [Casino case study](https://verifythis.github.io/02casino/). In this paper we discuss several specification solutions. In particular you find the following solutions:

* [uppaal]      -- Timed automata
* [supervisory] -- Nonblocking verification
* [tlaplus]  -- State machine specification with model checking
* [solc-verify]  -- Source-level deductive verification
* [secc]     -- Deductive verification
* [vercors]  -- Deductive verification
* [javabip]  -- Deductive verification of component-based systems
* [2vyper] -- Deductive verification with resource-based specifications
